    <h1>Concert Rewind</h1>
    <p>
        The main concept of our app is if you're going to attend a concert, you can search our app for the songs from the
        latest concert by that artist.  Then you can establish a playlist on Spotify of those songs so you can listen to them
        before the concert.  This will allow you to have a great time singing along at the concert.

    from their most recent tour.

    the HomeController, we will point the input name here; and here the form action will point to the Method name in the HomeController
    that Mike is working on. *@
